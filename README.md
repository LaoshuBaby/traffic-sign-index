## What is it?

The goal of this project is to turn [traffic sign IDs](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:traffic_sign#Traffic_sign_IDs)
into human-readable presets that can be used for tagging 
traffic signs in OpenStreetMap that don't have an equivalent
tagging scheme that's already [human-readable](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:traffic_sign#Human-readable_values).

This project is similar to the [name-suggestion-index](https://github.com/osmlab/name-suggestion-index), which is a canonical list of commonly used brands, operators, and networks for OpenStreetMap.
